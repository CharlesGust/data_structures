# Assignment

# When you're ready, create a new branch for your data-structures repository
#  and add a module to implement the sorting algorithm.

# Include an "if __name__ == '__main__':" block at the end of your module that
#  demonstrates the performance characteristics of this sort over a variety of
#  lengths of input in both the best and worst-case scenarios. Executing your
#  module should print informative output about the performance of your sort to
#  the terminal.

# Add tests to demonstrate that the sorting algorithm works.

# Add information about your implementation to the README.md in your package,
#  including any sources and collaborations you used in creating it.
