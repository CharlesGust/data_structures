#data_structures
#===============
This repository holds sample code for a number of classic data structures implemented in Python

##Collaborations
On the hashtable implementation, Ben Friedland helped convince me to use native Python
lists instead of the "Bucket" object I had created that I thought was a requirement of
the specification. The resulting code is a lot cleaner as a result.

##Resources
In general, I referenced the Python 2.x docs and Stack Overflow for many questions, particularly
around package, module importing in sibling directories. Unfortunately, I don't know where
I read the particular syntax to precede the package name with ".."
