####Doubly Linked List

####Insertion Sort

####Merge Sort

####Quick Sort

####Radix Sort

##Continuous Integration Status

##Collaborations
On the hashtable implementation, Ben Friedland helped convince me to use native Python
lists instead of the "Bucket" object I had created that I thought was a requirement of
the specification. The resulting code is a lot cleaner as a result.

General resources consulted include the Python Documentation and Wikipedia.

Ben Friedland also suggested reading about Quicksort at:
http://en.literateprograms.org/Quicksort_%28Python%29#Using_list_comprehensions
which was a very useful resource.

##Resources
In general, I referenced the Python 2.x docs and Stack Overflow for many questions, particularly
around package, module importing in sibling directories. Unfortunately, I don't know where
I read the particular syntax to precede the package name with ".."
